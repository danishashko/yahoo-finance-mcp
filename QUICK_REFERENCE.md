## üîç Tips for Better Results

### 1. Use Correct Ticker Symbols
- Always use the official ticker symbol (e.g., "AAPL" not "Apple Inc.")
- Tickers are case-insensitive (aapl, AAPL, Aapl all work)
- If you don't know the ticker, ask: "What's the ticker symbol for [company name]?"

### 2. Be Specific About Time Periods
- Instead of "show me the history", say "show me the last 6 months"
- Available periods: 1d, 5d, 1mo, 3mo, 6mo, 1y, 2y, 5y, 10y, ytd, max

### 3. Combine Multiple Questions
- "Show me Apple's price and compare it with Microsoft"
- "Get Tesla's financial statements and tell me about their profitability"

### 4. Ask for Explanations
- "What does PE ratio mean and what's Apple's PE ratio?"
- "Explain Tesla's financial metrics to me"

### 5. Request Specific Formats
- "Show me this data in a table"
- "Give me just the key numbers"
- "Format this as a comparison"
