## üöÄ Quick Start (npm)

### Install via npx (No installation required)

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on Mac or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` on Windows):

    "yahoo-finance": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "yahoo-finance-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

That's it! The server will auto-install Python dependencies on first run.

# Then use in Claude Desktop config:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "yahoo-finance": {

    }
  }
}
```

#### On Mac:

1. Open Terminal
2. Type: `nano ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
3. Add the following configuration (adjust the path to where you saved the file):

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "yahoo-finance": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["/path/to/yahoo_finance_mcp.py"]
    }
  }

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Command not found" or "Python not found"

**Solution:** Make sure Python is installed and in your PATH. Try using `python3` instead of `python` in the config file (especially on Mac/Linux).

### "Module not found: yfinance" or "Module not found: mcp"

**Solution:** Install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install yfinance pandas mcp
```

Or on Mac/Linux:
```bash
pip3 install yfinance pandas mcp
```

### "No such file or directory"

**Solution:** Double-check the path in your `claude_desktop_config.json`. Make sure:
- The path is correct and complete
- On Windows, use double backslashes (`\\`) or forward slashes (`/`)
- The file actually exists at that location

### Tools not showing up in Claude

**Solution:**
1. Make sure you saved the config file correctly
2. Restart Claude Desktop completely (quit and reopen)
3. Check that the JSON syntax is correct (no missing commas or brackets)

### "Error fetching data" messages

**Solution:**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the ticker symbol is correct (e.g., "AAPL" not "Apple")
- Some stocks may have limited data available
- Yahoo Finance API may be temporarily down

## üîí Privacy & Rate Limits

- This server uses the **free** Yahoo Finance API through the yfinance library
- All data requests go directly to Yahoo Finance - nothing is stored
- Yahoo Finance has rate limits (~2,000 requests/hour per IP)
- This is intended for **personal use only**, not commercial applications

## üìù Notes

- Stock tickers should be in UPPERCASE (AAPL, MSFT, TSLA, etc.)
- Market data may have a 15-20 minute delay for some stocks
- Not all data is available for every stock (especially smaller companies)
- Financial statements are typically available for larger public companies

## üÜò Getting Help
