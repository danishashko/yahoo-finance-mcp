## ‚úÖ Find the Server File Path

## ‚úÖ Claude Desktop Configuration

- [ ] I found where Claude Desktop's config file should be
  - Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
  - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

- [ ] I opened the config file in a text editor
- [ ] I added the server configuration
- [ ] I replaced the placeholder path with MY actual path
- [ ] I used the correct slash format:
  - Windows: Double backslash `\\` OR forward slash `/`
  - Mac/Linux: Forward slash `/`

- [ ] My config file looks like this:

**Windows:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "yahoo-finance": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["C:\\Users\\YourName\\Documents\\yahoo-finance-mcp\\yahoo_finance_mcp.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "yahoo-finance": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["/Users/YourName/Documents/yahoo-finance-mcp/yahoo_finance_mcp.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

- [ ] I saved the config file
- [ ] No text editor warnings or errors when saving

---

## ‚úÖ JSON Syntax Check

My config file has:
- [ ] Opening brace `{` at the start
- [ ] Closing brace `}` at the end
- [ ] All strings in double quotes `"like this"`
- [ ] Commas between items (but NOT after the last item)
- [ ] Square brackets `[` and `]` around the args array
- [ ] My actual path (not the example path)

---

## ‚úÖ Restart Claude Desktop

- [ ] I completely QUIT Claude Desktop (not just closed the window)
  - Windows: Right-click system tray icon ‚Üí Exit
  - Mac: Cmd+Q or right-click dock icon ‚Üí Quit
  
- [ ] I waited 5-10 seconds
- [ ] I reopened Claude Desktop
- [ ] Claude Desktop started successfully

---

## ‚úÖ Test the Server

I tried asking Claude:

- [ ] "What's the current price of Apple stock?"
- [ ] Claude responded with actual stock data
- [ ] No error messages appeared
- [ ] The response includes price information

If this worked: **üéâ SUCCESS! You're all done!**

If not, continue to troubleshooting...

## üÜò Still Stuck?

If you've checked everything and it still doesn't work:

1. Start over from the beginning
2. Follow SETUP_GUIDE.md step by step

4. Double-check the path in config file
5. Make sure config file syntax is EXACTLY right
6. Restart Claude Desktop after ANY config change

---

**Pro Tip:** The most common issue is an incorrect or misformatted path in the config file. Take your time to get that exactly right!
